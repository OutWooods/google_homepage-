# Google Homepage Project (for the [Odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/))

## About
This is a task was to make a copy of the google homepage (without the search functionality). It uses only HTML and CSS, and was built by looking at the original google page using dev tools. This was also my first attempt at using git on a project (apologies for the commit history...)

This task was part of the [Odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)\* a free online course teacing you web design (which I would highly reccomend). Its well structured, open source and totally free.  

## How to use

To view the page in all its glory go to [mock google](https://tagrand.github.io/google_homepage-/).

**Note** The links don't actually work, you cannot search on the page. But its quite fun to see how long it takes for people to use it and realise its not google (not that I have ever done this...)


## Reflection (Reccomended by Odin Project)

WWW: I enjoyed task and found it helpful to improve my understanding not only of HTML and CSS but also using developer tools to spot information from websites about their formatting and styling. I hadn't used this before, but am starting to understand it alot better. It has also been useful for me to practise my use of git and github. 

EBI: I avoided using git and github late on in the project. Meaning I committed my HTML and CSS files quite late on development, so my git log is rather short. It would have been better practise to commit more, so I could have a better record of developments and improvements. However I have got more confident with git, so hopefully this will prove less of a barrier next time.
