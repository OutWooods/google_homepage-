This is my first web page built for the Odin project.


Summary: The project was to make a copy of the google homepage (without the search functionality). 

Reflection
WWW: I enjoyed  task and found it helpful to improve my understanding not only of HTML and CSS but also using developer tools to spot information from websites about their formatting and styling. I hadn't used this before, but am starting to understand it alot better. It has also been useful for me to practise my use of git and github. 

EBI: I avoided using git and github late on in the project. Meaning I committed my HTML and CSS files quite late on development, so my git log is rather short. It would have been better practise to commit more, so I could have a better record of developments and improvements. However I have got more confident with git, so hopefully this will prove less of a barrier next time.
