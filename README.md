This is my first web page built for the Odin project.


The project was to make a copy of the google homepage (but it did not have to work like the google homepage). I enjoyed the overall task and found it helpful to improve my understanding not only of HTML and CSS but also using developer tools to spot information from websites about their formatting and styling. I hadn't used this before, but am starting to understand it alot better. 

Main thing I could have improved doing this project, is I committed my HTML and CSS files quite late on development, so my git log is very short. It would have been better practise to commit more, so I could have a better record of developments and improvements.
